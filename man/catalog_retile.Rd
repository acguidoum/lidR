\title{Retile a catalog}
\usage{
catalog_retile(ctg)
}
\arguments{
\item{ctg}{A \link[lidR:catalog]{LAScatalog} object}

\item{path}{string. The folder where the new files should be saved.}

\item{prefix}{character. The prefix of the written file name. It can be missing, in which case if the
catalog is processed by file, the original name of the file will be retained.}

\item{ext}{character. The format of the written files. Can be ".las" or ".laz".}

\item{alignment}{numeric vector. A vector of size 2 (x and y coordinates, respectively) to align the
pattern. By default the alignment is made along (0,0) as in all LAScatalog processes, meaning the edge
of a virtual tile will belong on x = 0 and y = 0 and all the the others will be multiples of the
tiling size.}

\item{...}{extra parameter 'filter' to pass to \link{readLAS} (readLAS is not actually called but
the parameter can be passed anyway).}
}
\value{
A new \code{LAScatalog} object
}
\description{
Splits or merges files to reshape the original catalog files (.las or .laz) into smaller or larger
files. It also enables the addition or removal of a buffer around the tiles. The new files are written
in a dedicated folder. The function first displays the layout of the new tiling pattern and then asks
the user to validate the command.
}
\details{
Internally the function reads and writes the clusters defined by the internal processing options of a
\link[lidR:LAScatalog-class]{LAScatalog} (see also \link{catalog}). Thus the function is flexible and
enables the user to retile the dataset, retile while adding or removing a buffer (negative buffers are
allowed), or optionally to compress the data by retiling without changing the pattern but by changing
the format (las/laz).\cr\cr

Note that this function is not actually very useful since \code{lidR} manages everything
(clipping, processing, buffering, ...) internally using the proper options. Thus, retiling may be useful
for working in other software for example, but not in \code{lidR}.
