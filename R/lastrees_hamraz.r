#' Individual tree segmentation
#'
#' The segmentation algorithm proposed by Hamraz et al. 2012 (see reference). The classification is
#' done at the point cloud level and the function returns nothing (NULL). The original point cloud
#' is updated in place with an ID for each point in a new column \code{treeID}. The user is free to
#' post-process this output the way he want.
#'
#' This function has been written by the \code{lidR} authors from the original article. We made our
#' best to implement as far as possible exactly what is written in the original paper but we
#' cannot affirm that it is this exact original algorithm.\cr\cr
#' Also it is important to notice that we have never been able to segment a single tree properly with
#' this method. The important sensitivity to minor deviation as well as the great number of difficultly
#' parametrizable imputs lead us to a method that we are not able to use ourselves.\cr\cr
#' Also, minor variations were introduced to fix some issues that were not adressed in the original paper.
#' Because the methods described in section 2.2 of the original article appear extremely sensitive to
#' many minor deviations, we introduced an optionnal additionnal step to clean the profiles used to build
#' the convex hull. When \code{filter_profiles = TRUE}, profiles that discribe a crown radius smaller than
#' \code{2*nps} (basically radius that are close to 0) are removed and the convex hull is build considering
#' the profiles that describe a crown radius comprise between the 10th and the 90th of the radiuses found.
#' This enable to remove outliers and reduce dummy segmentation but anyway we were not able to segment
#' the tree with this method.\cr\cr
#' As a conclusion this algorithm might be considered as a free and open source code provided to be
#' improved by the community. One can check and study the sources to ensure that it correspond to the
#' original paper and find potential improvement.\cr\cr
#' Also the current implementation is known to be slow.

#' @param las A LAS object
#' @param nps numeric. Nominal point spacing (see reference page 533  section 2)
#' @param th numeric. Minimal height. Point below this threshold are not condisered for the segmentation (see reference page 534 section 2)
#' @param MDCW numeric. Minimum detectable crown width (page 534 section 2)
#' @param epsilon numeric. Small deviation from vertical (page 535 section 2.2.2)
#' @param CLc numeric. Crown ratio of a narrow cone-shaped crown (page 535 equation 3)
#' @param Oc numeric. Crown radius reduction due to the overlap assuming the narrow cone-shaped tree is situated in a dense stand (page 535 equation 3)
#' @param CLs numeric. Crown ratio of a sphere-shaped crown (page 535 equation 4)
#' @param Os numeric. Crown radius reduction due to the overlap within a dense stand for the sphere-shaped tree (page 535 equation 4)
#' @param R numeric Maximum horizontal distance of vertical profiles (page 535 sectioh 2.1). Any value greater
#' than a crown is good because this parameter does not affect the result. However, it greatly affects the
#' computation speed. The lower the value, the faster the method.
#' @param gap_sensitivity integer. In the original article, page 535 section 2.2.1, gaps are detected
#' using six times the interquartile range of square root distance between consecutive points. This
#' paramter control this value. Default is 6.
#' @param filter_profiles logical. This is an addition to the original method to filter dummy profiles
#' (see details)
#' @param ... Supplementary options. Currently \code{field} is supported to change the default name of
#' the new column.
#'
#' @return
#' Nothing (NULL). The original point cloud is updated by reference. The original point cloud has a
#' new column named 'treeID' containing an ID for each point that refer to a segmented tree.
